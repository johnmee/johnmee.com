## Personal

Born in Sydney and enjoys a bachelor's life in Manly&mdash;NSW Australia.

Struggles to spend time away from keyboards, so when that does happen it is, ideally, a physical exercise; surfing [Fairy
Bower](https://goo.gl/maps/NvQMemQ1GjL2) is the #1 choice or, when the swell is not running, a ride on the bike&mdash;
[push](https://goo.gl/maps/jf9yE93Tokt) or [power](https://goo.gl/maps/LMswsXVCMGz)&mdash; will do.
Running on the spot at the gym is a distant third. Enjoys a good read, good company, 
a [franziskaner](https://www.franziskaner-weissbier.de/unsere-biere/hefe-weissbier-naturtrueb), a strategy game, 
one particular girl, a lamb roast, and [believes](http://anglicansonline.org/basics/nicene.html) in the existence of God.
Has mastered the artistry of a [La Pavoni Lever](http://www.lapavoni.com/domestic-line.php?idcategory=1).

## Job History


### FindBigMail

This longstanding hobby project gets a steady stream of donations and occasional accolades.  It finds and tags the biggest emails in your gmail
 account making it easy to stay under the size restraints of a free gmail account.  Driven by Google's mandatory
 upgrade to Oauth2 it was completely rewritten in 2014, from imap via PHP on bare metal, to GmailAPI via Python on heroku.
 
Responsibilities are everything from concept, to implementation, to maintenance; user support is handled by a sibling.

* overcomes significant challenges with the throttling of access to the Gmail API
* leverages Redis for queuing jobs, storing reports, and ensuring it _forgets_ everything
* successfully scales up and down to accommodate occasional [slashdot effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect)
* invokes a loosely coupled design to mitigate Google's periodic policy and implementation shafts
* took the hard decision, after much investment, to abandon the first rebuild attempt with google appengine; just too
many issues and not enough support. Heroku proves to be a superior platform.

[FindBigMail](https://findbigmail.com) July 2013 &rarr;  
[Python] ([Flask], [GmailAPI](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/?hl=en)), [Redis], [Heroku]

#### Freelance - Evolutionary Programming



Accepted an offer from a private individual to do the programming component of an IT Thesis on Evolutionary Programming: 
a program which builds a program (sic), with the ultimate goal of constructing a 3D model from a collection of 2D photographs.

* learnt what evolutionary programming is and soaked up all the established literature and concepts about it
* exchanged complex concepts with the client and created project plans, milestones, and delivery mechanisms
* implemented significant customizations to [DEAP]; (effectively pushing it as far as it could go 
short of rewriting their core engine)
* prepared and presented regular interactive demonstrations via a [Python Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), fully 
documenting and explaining each step, and delivering working models at the conceptual level the client required
* presented technical obstacles in understandable ways; devised solutions and laid them out with all the critical variables
necessary for informed decisions

* evaluated devops systems [ansible], [puppet], and [chef] for application to their systems (unsuitable)

#### Stock Backtesting

Constructed a system to leverage Amazon AWS to do backtesting, by brute force, of a trading idea for an entrepreneurial 
gentleman; basically looking for strong correlations.  Involved lots of multiprocessing and wrangling
the vast data output into meaningful reports.  We gave it a good go but, ultimately, failed to find a gap
in the market that could be exploited practically.

Dolby needed a Pythonista to support and rebuild an API, included in the VOIP solution of a recent aquisition, ready for
re-release as their [business voice communications and conferencing](http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-voice.html) system:

* assumed sole technical resposiblity for the API component of the system, providing authorization and room tokens 
to client programs connecting and connected to the system
* re-architeched and re-implemented the existing _quick hack_ solution into a solid, elegant, for-the-future codebase
 affording management considerable confidence in reliability, security, and ability to scale
* added new features, eg. the concept of _seats_, including fixed and variable numbers of them, and assignment of specific individuals
 to specific seats.
* worked with formal Quality Assurance testing for load and regression
* also maintained a PHP website for the [Dolby Axon](https://axon.dolby.com/) product, changing the payment model, 
appling new skins, and making other improvements to the registration system

* worked with a Systems administrator for operations and a frontend designer for presentation
* worked with marketing for direction, promotion, and reporting
* received recognition from webbyawards

* autonomously architect, develop, deploy, and operate the complete ticketing solutions
* implement features for early-bird specials, door-sales, ticket confirmation, accounting reports
and more 
* successfully pull off the [LOUDEvent] at the Sydney Entertainment Centre (~20,000 tix) and several [RICE](http://www.ricemovement.org/) events
