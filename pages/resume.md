## Personal

Born in Sydney and enjoys a bachelor's life in Manly&mdash;NSW Australia.

Struggles to spend time away from keyboards so, when that does happen, it is ideally a physical exercise.  Surfing [Fairy
Bower](https://goo.gl/maps/NvQMemQ1GjL2) is the #1 choice or, when the swell is not running, a ride on two wheels&mdash;
[push](https://goo.gl/maps/jf9yE93Tokt) or [motor](https://goo.gl/maps/LMswsXVCMGz)&mdash; will do.
Running on the spot at the gym is a distant third. Enjoys a good read, good company, 
a [franziskaner](https://www.franziskaner-weissbier.de/unsere-biere/hefe-weissbier-naturtrueb), [a strategy game](http://www.catan.com/), 
one very special girl, [a lamb roast](http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/7486/sues+roast+lamb), and [believes](http://anglicansonline.org/basics/nicene.html) in the existence of God.
