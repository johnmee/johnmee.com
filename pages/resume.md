![Caradvice](static/images/resume/caradvice.jpg)

### CarAdvice
<http://caradvice.com.au> | <http://bestprice.com.au>  
May 2013 &rarr; Feb 2015  

Caradvice is an online motoring magazine.  _Bestprice_ was a startup they attempted to spawn to
create a marketplace for purchasing new cars.  I built and implemented features (Python, Django, MySQL, backbone.js) for as long as it
lasted.  I assisted with a lot of the DevOps (AWS, PHP, MySQL) 
for CarAdvice proper as the workload fell off and bestprice was wound down.

### Dolby Laboratories
<http://dolby.com>  
February 2011 &rarr; November 2011  

Dolby acquired a (C code) IP voice client and needed to rebuild the API controller which coordinated
 and initiated client connections; to make it ready for
sale to [British Telecom](https://business.bt.com/products/voice/voip-phone-systems/cloud-voice/) as their
[business voice communications and conferencing solution](http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-voice.html).

Working alone, I successfully delivered a robust enterprise grade REST API to their specifications (Python/Django).

![fervr](static/images/resume/fervr.jpg)

### Youthworks
<http://fervr.net>  
February 2009 &rarr; February 2011  

Fervr (Fervour) is a facebook alternative for Christian youth groups in Australia provided by the Sydney Anglican Diocese.
It implements magazine content for adolescents, plus compartmentalized social networks
 for youth members aged 8-18 years.  Each group getting their own home pages, chats, photo sharing, and event
sharing.  

Working in a team of three, with a frontender and a marketeer, I was amazed how much facebook
functionality we could replicate.  We also ran an online shop via [Shopify]
and routinely published single-use promotional and ticketing websites for live events, included one
at the Sydney Entertainment Center.  All this work was acknowledged as 
[15th Annual Webby Awards Honoree (2011)](http://webbyawards.com/winners/2011/web/general-website/religion-spirituality/fervr/)

## Before that...

After graduating uni I was a [ColdFusion] guru, mostly working on data backed web applications as a contractor
 for companies like Genworth, Perpetual Trustees, Calson Marketing Group, the Roads and Traffic Authority, and others.
Some of those jobs included working with C#, Java, C++, Perl and a bunch of other esoteric solutions that 
people have lost interest in.
