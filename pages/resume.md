 He then globetrotted extensively working itinerant jobs until 2000 (9y).  In 2000, he started building data-backed websites with Adobe ColdFusion, spreading several years amongst a consulting
house, two long-forgotten startups, and a big marketing company (Carlson) for CBA.  He went back to Uni for a IT Masters and, via Genworth Financial,
 toyed with Java/Weblogic, then some C#.NET by freelance gigging and a contract with Perpetual Trustees (2y), before
 settling into Python. Feel free to ask about any of this time if it interests you.
