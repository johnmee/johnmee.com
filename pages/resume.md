## Personal

Born in Sydney and enjoys a bachelor's life in Manly&mdash;NSW Australia.

Struggles to spend time away from keyboards, so when that does happen it ideally involves exercise; surfing [Fairy
Bower](https://goo.gl/maps/NvQMemQ1GjL2) is the #1 choice or, when the swell is not running, a ride on the bike&mdash;
[push](https://goo.gl/maps/jf9yE93Tokt) or [power](https://goo.gl/maps/LMswsXVCMGz)&mdash; will do.
Running on the spot at the gym is a distant third. Enjoys a good read, good company, 
a [franziskaner](https://www.franziskaner-weissbier.de/unsere-biere/hefe-weissbier-naturtrueb), a strategy game, 
his girlfriend, a lamb roast, and [believes](http://anglicansonline.org/basics/nicene.html) in the existence of God.
Has mastered the artistry of a [La Pavoni Lever](http://www.lapavoni.com/domestic-line.php?idcategory=1).

Always intending to go to the [SyPy](http://sypy.org/) talks, even gets there sometimes.

## Job History

> Python

### FindBigMail

Works on this community service as a hobby project.  It finds and tags the biggest emails in your gmail
 account so it is easy to delete them and thus stay under the size restraints of a free account. Rewrote it
 from PHP over IMAP on bare metal when Matt first abandoned it.

[FindBigMail](https://findbigmail.com) December 2012 - Ongoing  
[Python] ([Flask], [GmailAPI](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/?hl=en)), [Redis], [Heroku]

#### Freelance - Evolutionary Programming

Did the programming component of an IT Thesis on Evolutionary Programming; developing a program which builds a program (sic)
to construct a 3D model from a collection of 2D photographs.

![Caradvice](/static/images/resume/caradvice.jpg)

### Caradvice

Took over technical responsibility for an internal startup, rebranded as [BestPrice], which sought to empower car
  buyers with a direct connection to car dealers in a competitive marketplace.  

Worked through a couple of pivots revamping both the
business model and the presentation to both the car buyer and the car dealer.  Ultimately BestPrice
has conceded defeat; the last task was to devolve the site into being merely a lead generator for external entities.

Over on the primary website, [Caradvice], improved the uptime and stability of CarAdvice by establishing 
monitoring and restart systems via [Munin], [Monit], and [Pingdom].  Also took
a long hard look at automated devops systems [ansible], [puppet], and [chef] but, in the end, deemed they were
overcomplicating the problem.

Still in contact, and perform the monthly site updates plus essential maintenance tasks, as required.

### Copyright Agency Limited

Short gig supporting a python application whilst an inhouse dev took a vacation. Was useful enough to be
 kept around a few weeks longer building scripting tasks to ease the workload of filtering, cataloging, 
 and processing the masses of scanned documents their business entails.

#### Stock Backtesting

Constructed a system to leverage Amazon AWS to do backtesting, by brute force, of a trading idea for an entrepreneurial 
gentleman; basically looking for strong correlations.  Involved lots of multiprocessing and wrangling
the vast data output into meaningful reports.  We gave it a good go but, ultimately, failed to find a gap
in the market that could be exploited practically.

####  Web Crawler

Consulting and development on a crawling system pulling news stories from ~4000 websites and RSS feeds and feeding 
them into a news context aggregation system for vertical markets which was grinding itself to death.  Found,
learnt, and implemented [Scrapy] to replace the fragile bespoke PHP code.

high quality marketing plan; essentially a weighty question and answer workflow which compiles all the answers

 communications](http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-voice.html) and conferencing system client apps and
 devices: to create, connect, and disconnect to voice rooms, issuing tokens, et cetera. 
 Involved a lot of formal testing for load and regression.  Built with Python and Django and the [Django Rest Framework][django-rest-framework].
 Added the concept of _seats_, including fixed and variable numbers of them, and assignment of specific individuals
 to specific seats.

Also maintained a PHP website for the [Dolby Axon](https://axon.dolby.com/) product; changed the payment model, 
applied new skins and made other improvements to the registration system.

 group chat, group photo sharing, in addition to sitewide magazine-style content and a question and answer
 forum.

![LOUDEvent](/static/images/resume/loudevent.jpg)

Plus built several one-off event ticketing sites to take event bookings and handle the money.

goals and review them periodically. Managers and employees complete their feedback separately, then come

### Perpetual Trustees

Assisted in a massive data transformation/migration project to get all their client data off three legacy systems
onto a shiny new one.  Involved a complex process of abstracting data from each application model into common form 
then reshaping it to fit the new data model. And process ~30GB of it between COB friday and Monday morning!
