# 2019

**The Sydney Hobart Yacht Race - Rob Mundle - (2019) - [HarperCollins](https://www.harpercollins.com/9781460711019/sydney-hobart-yacht-race/)**

Started strong with a fascinating story of some sailors who got together for an ocean cruise, and how that morphed into
the great race that we have today.  Thence it extracts the essence of the drama from year on year.  Does well for a time,
but somewhere along the way the weather turns and it becomes a tortuous upwind slog; just grinding out the catalogue
of line honours and handicap winners.  My advice to readers: turn up for a colourful start, but dock at Bega, or
 wherever the going gets tough, and abandon it there.

**D-day. Through German Eyes - Holger Eckhertz - (2015) - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com.au/DAY-Through-German-Eyes-Hidden-ebook/dp/B00VX372UE/)**

Excellent.  By focusing on their personal experience of D-Day we get rare insights into exactly what was like to
be a soldier in combat and, most interestingly, attitudes, points-of-view, and even the people around them.  Like
the workmen from the East, and what happened to the Russians, the gamble of allegiance the French had to make, the
'Fortress Europe' justification, the shock at how determined the Allied soldiers were to kill them, the great imbalance
of available resources and more.  Personal experiences recorded within 10 years of the events (~1955) but not released
until recently.

**Riddle of the sands - Erskine Childers - (1903) - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riddle_of_the_Sands)**

Meh.  It held my interest.  I was intrigued by how one can write a whole book from what is effectively a bit of floating
around some sandy shallows in a small boat.  I can understand how it became popular as a boys own adventure story, as
that is what it is.  I'm into sailing so that captured me.  The narrative was odd and irritating at first, but I came
to rather like it by the end.  So very Proper.  I was surprised that war between Germany/Britain was being forecast ten 
years before it happened.

**Stranger No More - Annahita Parsan/Graig Borlase - (2017) - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-No-More-Harrowing-Miraculous/dp/1400207517)**

Harrowing autobiography of an Iranian mother and her escape from domestic abuse and Iran in the late 1980s.
