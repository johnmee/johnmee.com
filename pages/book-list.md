**Prayer: Experiencing awe and intimacy with God - Timothy Keller - [Hodder & Stoughton](https://www.koorong.com/product/prayer-experiencing-awe-and-intimacy-with-god-timothy-keller_9781444750171)**

A very cerebral and structured examination of prayer broken into two halves: first he studies basic questions like
what is prayer, why do it, what does it look like, some history and more objective aspects.  Second is a study of
the subjective work of actually praying: what, where, how, etc.

I've been struggling to get through this book.  It is great to examine the topic objectively as he does, but
perhaps the style of writing is not for me: as I read I notice myself flicking ahead to see how many more pages
in the chapter, then flicking back to recall the context of the words in hand.  I think it is a crucial topic, 
so am very motivated to read it, but nonetheless it is gathering dust with a bookmark still in the middle somewhere.

Structured and pragmatically academic; not yet complete.

**Groundswell: The Christian Surfers Story - Brett Davis - (2012) - [SelfPublished](https://www.christiansurfers.net/groundswell-book)**

A lot of what is described in the early years, and chapters, of this read was occuring not far from where I myself
was, and the people I knew at the time, or do now.  So it was quite naturally very interesting to me.  "Wow, I know
that guy" and "That was about the time I..." were fairly common thoughts, so I expect my appreciation of the content
may be very different to others.

The opening third of this autobiography (effectively) was poignant and moving as the young Brett Davis commits himself
to God and the mission, and forms a revolutionary counter-culture within a culture which has rejected, well, the "normal"
culture.  It's a great read.

Then as the organisation gets established and more people come to bear the story itself suffers considerably, as it
devolves into a listing of who was who and doing what; no doubt to give everyone credit, there are certainly snippets
of other people's stories as the movement becomes international, which maintain the interest, but are necessarily
superficial.  Fortunately it closes strong by returning to personal stories.

Fascinating start. Bit of a grind through the middle. Nice flourish to finish.

**The Sydney Hobart Yacht Race - Rob Mundle - (2019) - [HarperCollins](https://www.harpercollins.com/9781460711019/sydney-hobart-yacht-race/)**

Started strong with a fascinating story of some sailors who got together for an ocean cruise, and how that morphed into
the great race that we have today.  Thence it extracts the essence of the drama from year on year.  Does well for a time,
but somewhere along the way the weather turns and it becomes a tortuous upwind slog; just grinding out the catalogue
of line honours and handicap winners.  My advice to readers: turn up for a colourful start, but dock at Bega, or
 wherever the going gets tough, and abandon it there.

**D-day. Through German Eyes - Holger Eckhertz - (2015) - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com.au/DAY-Through-German-Eyes-Hidden-ebook/dp/B00VX372UE/)**

Excellent.  By focusing on their personal experience of D-Day we get rare insights into exactly what was like to
be a soldier in combat and, most interestingly, attitudes, points-of-view, and even the people around them.  Like
the workmen from the East, and what happened to the Russians, the gamble of allegiance the French had to make, the
'Fortress Europe' justification, the shock at how determined the Allied soldiers were to kill them, the great imbalance
of available resources and more.  Personal experiences recorded within 10 years of the events (~1955) but not released
until recently.

**Riddle of the sands - Erskine Childers - (1903) - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riddle_of_the_Sands)**

Meh.  It held my interest.  I was intrigued by how one can write a whole book from what is effectively a bit of floating
around some sandy shallows in a small boat.  I can understand how it became popular as a boys own adventure story, as
that is what it is.  I'm into sailing so that captured me.  The narrative was odd and irritating at first, but I came
to rather like it by the end.  So very Proper.  I was surprised that war between Germany/Britain was being forecast ten 
years before it happened.

**Stranger No More - Annahita Parsan/Graig Borlase - (2017) - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-No-More-Harrowing-Miraculous/dp/1400207517)**

Harrowing autobiography of an Iranian mother and her escape from domestic abuse and Iran in the late 1980s.
