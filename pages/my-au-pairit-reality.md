# My brush with Reality TV

> Hi, I am interested in renting your room.
  We're shooting a docu series for Finnish TV. We need a place where we can 
  freely film our occupant and their life.  The occupant is an au pair from Finland working 
  and living in Sydney for 3 months.

This was not your run-of-the-mill airbnb guest request and initially I was thinking "yikes, steer
clear of that".  But it's something different, so why not?

I checked into the background of the enquirer and found mixed reviews; perhaps it is 
not that easy to find people comfortable with this proposition. So I softened, doubled my price, and sent
back my terms.  They agreed.

## Arrival

You know the arrival shot where the host opens the door with a look of pseudo-surprise like they had no 
idea there was someone out there.  What really goes on before that?  I've always wondered.  And now I know...

It is true that I was opening the door to the "star" of the show for the first time.  In fact, I'd had
no contact whatsoever with her in the entire lead-up to that moment&mdash;something not normal with my guests
and, I think, a contributory factor to the end result.

Before the star arrived, fairly late in the evening, around 9:30pm, the 'producer' arrived at my door&mdash;hi,
how do you do, I'm the producer, may I see the room, ok, I'll be back&mdash;she came in and looked around
and called in the cameraman.  They looked around and discussed if the lighting was adequate, and chatted
briefly to me.  

Before that moment, I was inclined to stay out of the picture altogether, but the producer reassured me
that it was Finnish TV and terrible odds of it ever appearing anywhere else in the world, especially since
it's all in Finnish.  So heck, nothing to fear here, I signed the 'release' form declaring they could 
film me, and my place, and do whatever they wanted with the footage for the rest of eternity. Whatevs.

They promptly left&mdash;We'll be back.

Ok. I twiddled my fingers wondering when.  Ten minutes. They came back. The cameraman had a tripod and 
one of those big square lighty things you might've seen that
throws white light on interview subjects.  He gave me one of those microphone packs you see tucked into the
back of the girls dresses and had me hide it inside my clothing. They looked around some more and we 
turned all the lights on. I chatted conspiratorially to the Australian cameraman.

Then they all left.  Ten minutes.

A new face came in&mdash;it was an open house by this stage&mdash;Hi I'm the producer, can I see the room&mdash;
this is the woman with whom I'd negotiated the booking via email.

Then she left.  Shutting the door behind her.

Five minutes.

Knock Knock.

## Welcome

![Susa-AuPairit](/static/images/susa-au-pairit.jpg)

A knock on the door. I opened. So, yes, it's true, I'd never met this person before and didn't even know 
her name (Susa), and here she was at the door.  For her part, same deal: she'd
never met me.  It was all very genuine.  And yet it was nothing of the sort.

She had no goal to evaluate the space as somewhere acceptable to sleep, or me as a person who could be trusted
under the same roof. We played our parts but the absence of these crucial components of a _real_ guest arrival,
made it ingenuine.  She was&mdash;Hi, yep, here I am. I'm used to ignoring the people behind 
us, just show me where to stand and take your turn.
 
But there was more. There was something else not quite right. She was a passenger on a bus and wasn't at all 
interested in what was going on. She was simply enduring it; waiting for the end of the ride.

I went through my usual welcome routine, showing the guest where everything is. She watched without interest.
No questions. Barely a word uttered. Aaaand _CUT!_  Sadly, they didn't actually shout _Action_ or _Cut_.

## Settling In

The team said thanks, that was great, you're a natural. Let's do a scene of the subject opening her bags and
settling into the room.  I hung back and watched with interest, but tried to keep out of sight of the subject
 as I didn't want to contribute to her sense of being a performing seal. _CUT!_

## Interview

They sat her down on the bed and fiddled around with the lighting. The producer settled in opposite. This was
the little-deeper how-are-you-feeling piece to camera. The producer started asking questions in Finnish. This
went on for a while and I gradually lost interest and went back to my computer to while away some time. They
talked for thirty or fourty minutes. _THAT'S A WRAP!_

## We'll be back

It was nearing 11pm and they were done and started packing up.  There was some discussion that they would
leave her for two nights and be back Friday morning to film her departure. And finally they left. I saw them
to the door and turned back to the guest, hoping to get a more genuine sense of her without the pressure of the crew.
But her door was firmly closed; she was done.

## Goodnight

I pottered around doing my evening routine, cleaning up and brushing teeth. She came out for a moment and I tried to
make a connection but she was clearly exhausted. I got an affirmative response to 'tough day?', and
managed to confirm that she had not felt safe at the home where she'd been. I wanted to reassure her that she
was safe and they were gone and to help her relax, but I didn't for fear it would have the opposite effect&mdash;who
would trust a stranger who says 'trust me'?!

The cameraman earlier revealed to me that she'd been placed with a family in South Granville&mdash;a suburb of
Sydney not known for either it's safety nor affluence; an area currently popular with foreign immigrants due
to it's proximity to the Lakemba Mosque.  It is in the neighbourhood of some well established welfare recipients;
certainly not wealthly families in fancy houses with the ways, means, and mentaility of having a nanny. 
The cameraman winked that maybe the placement was deliberately chosen to _create tension._

## Goodbye

I went to bed and the guest light stayed on until after I'd passed out.  At about 4:30AM I got up for the toilet and
saw the guest bedroom door open.  Maybe it was too hot with the door closed? I didn't look in and went back to bed. 
But my mind processed it.
Where was the luggage? Not my business. Or is it? At length I got up for another look.  The room was empty, the bed
unslept in, the key left on the bureau. My guest was gone.

Whilst I'm right next to the public transport in Manly, there is none after midnight. It was pouring rain outside.
The only transport was an expensive taxi ride. Where would she go? Was she huddled in the cold and wet somewhere of
 an unfamiliar city in a land far, far from home?  I was a bit worried about this turn of events. What should I do? 
 I didn't have a phone number
for her, and had only a foreign phone number for the producer.  She is 18 years old, an adult, so I rejected notifying 
police as a responsibility. All I could do was email the producer to say her charge was gone.  I went back to
bed&mdash;deal with it in the morning.

## Epilogue

The producer got back to me at about 9AM thanking me for the note and stating that my guest had informed her that
she'd gone to a 'friend's.  I guess she took off as soon as she figured I was asleep; about midnight. I was a little
hurt that she felt she had to _escape_, but understand how natural it would be to include me as part of the system
she wanted a break from.  My guess is that the placement in Granville was traumatic and she had so little sense
of control over her situation, that sneaking away in the middle of the night was the drastic action neccesary to reclaim
her life.

I wonder if she continued with the program?
